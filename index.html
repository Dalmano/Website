					<h2>(That's me)</h2>
					<p> Here's a little about myself...</p>
				</header>
				<div class="content">
					<p>I was born at age zero and have survived as a successful living organism on this planet until present day. My biology consists of three components: 1. a structural mass, 2. a nervous system which detects external forces exerting pressure upon my mass and 3. a muscular system which exerts equal and opposite pressure, thus maintaining my equilibrium.</p>
					<p>My country of origin is South Africa, more specifically Cape Town (Latitude: -34.055378 | Longitude: 18.4797459). Growing up in this young but great nation taught me many things, one of those things being the great sport of rugby. You learn a lot of things playing a full contact sport from a young age; you overcome certain barriers that could only be solved through the love of a sport, not alone but as a team. Being a part of a such a game teaches you key life skills that are drilled into you from an early age, and stick with you for a lifetime:  never give up, play like its your last game, and to always pick yourself back up. For me and for many others, rugby was never just a sport, it was a life lesson.</p>
					<p>At the age of 15, I relocated to the United Kingdom with my family. I was both curious and excited for what London had to offer. This is not a life story; this is a brief introduction. If you would like the full shabang, please feel free to email me at dalmano@outlook.com. Fast forward a few years, add in a few grey/less hairs and wrinkles and here I am. I graduated with a Bsc in Exercise and Sport Science at Manchester Metropolitan University. I then progressed on to working for a supplement company up till a few months ago when I decided to Splice( ) myself from the equation and focus all my efforts on to a new life of code. </p>
					<p>I am applying for the programme for more than one reason. Firstly, and perhaps most obviously, is the fact that I am trying to start a new career in Software Development and I believe this is a great way to improve my knowledge on the subject. Secondly, Founders and Coders offers a great bootcamp which is free of charge but offers the opportunity of ‘giving back’ by the peer-led programme. From a former outsiders’ perspective of the tech industry, finding the right place to increase your knowledge can be a daunting task. But those aren't the only reasons. From what I have seen and heard about F&C, there is a great ‘giving back’ ethos. This is one of the main reasons for my application to the programme. At the information session I learnt that there may be an opportunity for individuals to help start up a cohort in South Africa.  My parents grew up in an apartheid regime, and we left for better opportunities for me and my siblings. I would love the opportunity to be able to give back to a community in South Africa. Lacking in opportunities yet thriving in potential and talent, I would like to give back to those individuals that we're not as lucky as me.

						<h3>FreeCodeCamp</h3>
						<p>This is where I learnt the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I has no previous coding experience so it was all new to me. It was challanging as it's completely new to me, but I love a challange.</p>
